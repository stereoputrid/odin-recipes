        <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Tamales are a traditional Mexican dish made with a corn based dough mixture that is filled with various meats or beans and cheese. 
                    Tamales are wrapped and cooked in corn husks or banana leaves, but they are removed from the husks before eating. Try them served 
                    with pico de gallo on top and a side of guacamole and rice.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                        <li>Masa harina</li>
                        <li>Broth</li>     
                        <li>Baking Powder</li>
                        <li>Salt</li>
                        <li>Cumin</li>
                        <li>Lard</li>
                        <li>Dried corn husks</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                        <li>Soak the corn husks.  Place corn husks in a bowl of very hot water for 30 minutes or until softened.</li>
                        <li>Prepare desired filling. You’ll need about 3 ½-4 cups of filling for one batch of tamale dough. </li>
                        <li>Make the masa dough: In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the lard and 2 tablespoons of broth until fluffy, about 3-5 minutes. Combine the masa flour, 
                            baking powder, salt, and cumin in a medium bowl; stir into the lard mixture and beat well with an electric mixer. Add the broth, little by little to form a very 
                            soft dough. Beat on high speed for several minutes. The dough should spread like creamy peanut butter and be slightly sticky. Cover the mixing bowl with a damp 
                            paper towel, to keep the dough from drying out.
